## Hi, my name's Akira ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at the University of Waterloo in Computer Engineering. Looking for interesting projects to work on!

I'm proficient in Python, SQL, Java and HTML/CSS. I'm currently learning C and C++.

I've built web apps, machine learning models, data analysis scripts, two robots, done research in signals processing and more :) If you want to see my previous projects, look down below &#8595;
